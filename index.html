        <p class="para">My hobby is making YouTube videos because of all the fun enjoyment you get while making them, and if you doing one with friends or other people, it's even MORE fun! What most of my videos are Minecraft, but I do also make some Roblox videos, tutorials and many more! I am a very small channel right now, at 55 subscribers but it'll go a bit higher in the future. I chose this hobby because when you get 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch time hours, you can start making money! It's amazing. And that is why my favorite hobby is making YouTube videos.
